This is the biggest project I have done so far, not including the one which is lost because of my own fault while reinstalling Windows.

#Navigation
All the links from navbar & search logic works, feel free to check it for yourself.
For Product page click on the title of the product.
Also you can go to checkout by opening cart and pressing 'checkout' btn.

Technologies used:
Vite,
Browser Router (actually HashRouter because I had troubles while deploying project to gh-pages but the functionality is same),
Redux Toolkit for state management,
React Intersection Observer,
twin.macro, React Icons, hooks etc.

Hope you'll like it! :)
