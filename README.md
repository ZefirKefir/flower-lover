This is the biggest project I have done so far, not including the one which is lost because of my own fault while reinstalling Windows.

Technologies used:
Vite,
Browser Router (actually HashRouter because I had troubles while deploying project to gh-pages but the functionality is same),
Redux Toolkit for state management,
React Intersection Observer,
twin.macro, React Icons, hooks etc.

Unfortunately the site is in Russian language which can seem bad for certain people, I wanted to keep the design the same as it was with the same fonts which were specially chosen because of their responsibleness with Cyrillic symbols, so just translate it to English with your browser tools if you need to.
Hope you'll like it! :)
